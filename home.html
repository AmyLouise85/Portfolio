        <p> Lets get one thing clear..Amy Louise isn't a geek.. she's just a super keen developer in the making..!</p>
        <p>Her interest in coding started circa 2003ish, when at the tender age of 18/19 she was given a £5,000 grant by 'The Big Boost' Lottery fund to start up her own customised clothing company. The internet was starting to be a ‘big thing' and she understood she needed a website to reach her audience,to link to my MYSPACE and eBay auctions, showcase her work, keep a blog and to have a ‘web presence’. She wasn't able to afford someone to develop a site so she decided to teach herself how to create a website. In the mid 2000's, CSS and JavaScript were not super popular so trusty HTML was used to style and code her entire website. (VERY basic in design and eye wateringly garish it’s still there on a dark corner of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/planet/princessalmighty/index.html">Angelfire’s servers</a>  and yes.. she did all of her own graphics using the splendour of MS paint!) The 100’s of hours she spent learning and researching this entirely new and alien language stayed with her and was always something she looked back on fondly. Even now, she still gets a kick from writing a line of code, refreshing and seeing the changes happen instantly. She also still enjoys putting on her Sherlock Holmes cap and discovering bugs and breaks. The thrill recieved from fixing that (inevitable) ‘405 html error’ so her pages appear perfectly again, is still there! </p>
